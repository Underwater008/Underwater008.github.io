# Underwater008.github.io

## Overview

Source code repository for my personal website.

## Future Ideas to Implement

- ***Update portfolio**: Update and merge portfolio website into this website.
- ***Webgl Player**: Add interactive elements.

## Notes to Self

This section is a reminder of the tools, frameworks, and techniques I used to build and maintain this website:
- "transfadein" need appear() to be show. 

- ***Build and deploy**: 
When ready to deploy, tell Vite to run a production build â€”
```bash
npx vite build 
```
Everything used by the application will be compiled, optimized, and copied into the dist/ folder. The contents of that folder are ready to be hosted on githb.
