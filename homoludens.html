                <p>As Johan Huizinga wrote in his 1938 book, "Homo Ludens", play is a crucial part of human culture and
                    influences how we develop as a society. Play is not just for fun, but affects many areas of our
                    lives like language, art, and religion. This concept has inspired researchers to study the role of
                    play in various fields, and the idea of becoming a Homo Ludens has become more important than ever.

                    <span>Children at play are often seen as carefree and simply having fun, but according to Johan
                        Huizinga's concept of Homo Ludens, play is much more than that. It's a way for children to learn
                        and develop their social, cognitive, and physical skills. By engaging in imaginative play,
                        children can explore new ideas, understand social norms, and develop creativity. The idea of
                        play as a crucial part of human culture has inspired researchers to study its effects on various
                        fields, and its significance has only become more important in today's world.</span>

                <div id="media-container">
                    <span>The concept of play as a vital part of human culture, has been influential in various
                        fields, including the world of video games. In particular, the game "Death Stranding" by Hideo
                        Kojima explores the idea of Homo Ludens through its gameplay mechanics and narrative. In the
                        game,
                        players take on the role of a courier in a post-apocalyptic world, where they must navigate
                        treacherous terrain, manage resources, and build connections with other players to survive.
                        Through
                        these gameplay elements, "Death Stranding" emphasizes the importance of cooperation,
                        communication,
                        and creativity, which are all key aspects of play as described by Huizinga. Overall, "Death
                        Stranding" serves as an example of how video games can not only be a form of entertainment but
                        also
                        a medium for exploring and promoting the concept of Homo Ludens.</span>

                    <p>Johan Huizinga (1872-1945) was a Dutch historian and cultural theorist. He is best known for his
                        book "Homo Ludens", which explores the role of play in human culture and society. In the book,
                        Huizinga argues that play is not just a leisure activity, but a fundamental aspect of human
                        nature that influences language, art, and religion.</p>
                    <p>Born in Groningen, the Netherlands, Huizinga studied classics and history at the University of
                        Groningen. He later became a professor of history at the University of Leiden. Huizinga's work
                        was influential in the development of cultural history and continues to be studied and discussed
                        today.</p>
